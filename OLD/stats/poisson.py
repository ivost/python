    A Poisson experiment is a statistical experiment that has the following properties:

    The outcome of each trial is either success or failure.
    The average number of successes sigma that occurs in a specified region is known.
    The probability that a success will occur is proportional to the size of the region.
    The probability that a success will occur in an extremely small region is virtually zero.
    A Poisson random variable is the number of successes that result from a Poisson experiment.
    The probability distribution of a Poisson random variable is called a Poisson distribution.
    example: for k=3, s=3 -> 0.180

    Task
    The manager of a industrial plant is planning to buy a machine of either type A  or type B.
    For each dayâ€™s operation:
    The number of repairs, X, that machine A needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 0.88.
    The daily cost of operating A is 160 + 40 * X**2
    The number of repairs, Y, that machine B needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 1.55.
    The daily cost of operating B is 128 + 40 * Y**2

    On the first line, print the expected daily cost of machine A.
    On the second line, print the expected daily cost of machine B.
